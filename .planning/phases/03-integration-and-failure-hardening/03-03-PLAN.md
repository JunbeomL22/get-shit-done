<objective>
Close the FAIL-02 verification gap by adding a minimal resume hint to the YOLO STOPPED banner and softening the ROADMAP success criterion wording.

Purpose: Verification found that the Case B1 STOPPED banner shows the failed phase and gaps but lacks any guidance on what to do next. The user-approved resolution is to add a minimal "To investigate" hint (not a full resume command) and update ROADMAP SC3 to match.

Output: Updated yolo.md (source + installed) with resume hint in Case B1 banner, updated ROADMAP.md with softened SC3 wording.

Three targeted edits:

**Edit 1 — Source yolo.md (get-shit-done/workflows/yolo.md):**

In the Case B1 STOPPED banner (around line 218-231), find the banner block:

```
Display YOLO STOPPED banner (locked decision: show phase number + gaps, NO resume command):
```

Change the parenthetical from "NO resume command" to "minimal resume hint per amended decision".

Then in the banner itself, after the line:

```
YOLO state preserved. See {VERIFY_FILE} for full report.
```

Add a new line:

```
To investigate: `/gsd:plan-phase {STOPPED_PHASE} --gaps`
```

The full banner block should become:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD > YOLO STOPPED — Phase {STOPPED_PHASE}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Verification failed: Phase {STOPPED_PHASE} has unmet requirements.

**What was missing:**
{gaps section from VERIFICATION.md}

YOLO state preserved. See {VERIFY_FILE} for full report.
To investigate: `/gsd:plan-phase {STOPPED_PHASE} --gaps`
```

**Edit 2 — Installed yolo.md (/home/junbeom/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/yolo.md):**

Apply the exact same changes as Edit 1. The installed copy uses absolute paths (`/home/junbeom/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs`) but the banner text is identical to the source copy.

**Edit 3 — ROADMAP.md (.planning/ROADMAP.md):**

Find Phase 3 Success Criterion 3:

```
  3. On stop, the user sees the phase number that failed, the specific gaps reported, and the command to resume after fixing
```

Change to:

```
  3. On stop, the user sees the phase number that failed, the specific gaps reported, and how to investigate
```

Only change the ending phrase — keep the criterion number and everything else identical.

**What NOT to do:**
- Do NOT add a full `/gsd:yolo` resume command — that is Phase 4 scope
- Do NOT change Case B2 (unexpected error) banner — it already has "Investigate manually" guidance
- Do NOT change any Phase C logic, state writes, or routing — only the display text
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify all three edits:

1. `grep -n "To investigate" get-shit-done/workflows/yolo.md` — should match the new hint line in Case B1
2. `grep -n "To investigate" /home/junbeom/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/yolo.md` — should match the same line in installed copy
3. `grep -n "how to investigate" .planning/ROADMAP.md` — should match updated SC3
4. `grep -c "NO resume command" get-shit-done/workflows/yolo.md` — should return 0 (old parenthetical removed)
5. Both yolo.md copies should still have "Do NOT auto-retry" after Case B1 banner (no accidental deletion)
  </verify>
  <done>
The Case B1 STOPPED banner in both yolo.md copies contains the line "To investigate: `/gsd:plan-phase {STOPPED_PHASE} --gaps`" and ROADMAP.md Phase 3 SC3 reads "how to investigate" instead of "the command to resume after fixing". FAIL-02 gap is closed.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Source yolo.md Case B1 banner includes "To investigate" hint line
2. Installed yolo.md Case B1 banner includes identical "To investigate" hint line
3. ROADMAP.md Phase 3 SC3 wording updated to "how to investigate"
4. No other changes to yolo.md logic, state writes, or routing
5. Case B2 banner unchanged
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- FAIL-02 gap closed: STOPPED banner shows phase number, specific gaps, AND how to investigate
- ROADMAP SC3 matches implementation (no more conflict between locked decision and success criterion)
- Both yolo.md copies (source and installed) are in sync
</success_criteria>
